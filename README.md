'Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond' course code and notes

## Contents

- Folders have been enumerated in the order of which they were added
- `notes` includes notes from external sources, such as [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/), and from the course itself.

## Notes in Code

- To visualize notes right next to their example implementations that are scattered throughout this repository, I'd recommend using the VS Code extension `Todo Tree`, and then just filter for any comment with a `NOTE` prefix to it.

  - e.g. `// NOTE This contains a note`

- You can also just search for `NOTE` (case sensitive and with one whitespace afterwards) in the IDE of your choice and it should show every note in the project.
