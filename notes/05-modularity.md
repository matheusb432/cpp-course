# C++ Modularity ðŸŽ®

C++ can achieve modularity through the use of _namespaces_, _header files_, and _header guards_.

## Namespaces

A _namespace_ is a region that allows you to declare names inside of it for the purpose of disambiguation.

- Any name that is not defined inside a class, function, or a namespace is considered to be part of the global namespace (or global scope).

## Header Files

- Header files from `std` should be included without the `.h` file extension

- Each file should explicitly #include all of the header files it needs to compile. Do not rely on headers included transitively from other headers.

- If your header files are written properly and #include everything they need, the order of inclusion shouldnâ€™t matter.

- Do **not** define variables and functions in header files.

### Header Guards

- _Header guards_ should be used to ensure header files only get defined once.

- Header guards prevent duplicate inclusions because the first time a guard is encountered, the guard macro isnâ€™t defined, so the guarded content is included. Past that point, the guard macro is defined, so any subsequent copies of the guarded content are excluded.

```cpp
#ifndef MY_FILE
#define MY_FILE

// content here

#endif
```

In modern C++, `#pragma once` can be used instead, but it may not work on esoteric platforms:

```cpp
#pragma once

// your code here
```
