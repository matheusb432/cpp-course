## Primitive Types

_Primitive types_ are the most basic types in C++. They are the building blocks for all other types. Some of them are:

- _character types_ - are used to represent characters (e.g. `char`, `wchar_t`).
- _numerical integer types_ - are used to represent integers (e.g. `int`, `long`, `short`, `long long`) and their unsigned counterparts (e.g. `unsigned int`, `unsigned long`, ...).
- _floating-point types_ - are used to represent real numbers (e.g. `float`, `double`, `long double`).

- **The size and precision of the types is often compiler-dependent**. The `sizeof()` operator can be used to get the size of a type in bytes.
