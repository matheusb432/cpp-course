# Object-Oriented Programming in C++ ðŸŽ®

## Classes

- In C++, it's common to separate the declaration of a class from its implementation, creating a pattern similar to interfaces.

```cpp
// MyClass.h
class MyClass {
public:
    void my_method();
};

// MyClass.cpp
#include "MyClass.h"

void MyClass::my_method() {
    // ...
}
```

### Constructors

- _Constructor initialization lists_ are used to initialize member variables before the body of the constructor is executed. This can lead to more efficient code as the default constructors for the member variables are not called.

```cpp
// ? `foo` is initialized before the body of the constructor is executed
MyClass::MyClass(int foo, int bar) : foo { foo } { /* ... */ }
```

- _Delegating constructors_ are constructors that call another constructor of the same class.

```cpp
// ? Invokes the constructor that takes two arguments
MyClass::MyClass() : MyClass{ 0, 0 } { /* ... */ }
```

### Destructors

_Destructors_ are special member methods that are called when an object is destroyed.

- They're invoked automatically when an object goes out of scope, or when `delete` is called on a pointer to an object.

- Destructors are useful for releasing resources that were allocated by the object to prevent memory leaks.

```cpp
class Player {
public:
    // ? Constructor
    Player();
    // ? Destructor
    ~Player();
};
```

### Class Friends

_Class Friends_ are functions or classes that are allowed to access private members of a class.

- Class friends are declared using the `friend` keyword.

### Accessing Members

- Class members (attributes and methods) are private by default.
- Members can be accessed using the `.` operator if they're an object, or the `->` operator if they're a pointer.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int public_attribute;
};

int main() {
    MyClass my_object;
    my_object.public_attribute = 5;

    MyClass* my_pointer = &my_object;
    my_pointer->public_attribute = 5;
    // Is equivalent to
    // (*my_pointer).public_attribute = 5;
}
```

## Templates

_Templates_ are a feature of C++ that allow you to write generic code that can be used with any type.

- The compiler can use a single template to generate a family of related functions or classes, each using a different set of types.
