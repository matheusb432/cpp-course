# C++ Intro ðŸŽ®

C++ is a high-performance programming language that blends object-oriented and procedural features. It's key for building efficient game engines, or using existing ones (e.g. _Unreal Engine_), enabling direct control over hardware, and providing the flexibility needed to craft immersive gaming experiences. It's a must-know language for game devs.

## What is C++?

- Even though it's almost 40 years old, C++ is still one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and is the backbone for many critical systems, such as databases, operating systems, and game engines.
- C++ is a _compiled_, _low-level_, _statically typed_ and _multi-paradigm_ language. It's _extremely_ fast, while also being scalable and portable, at the cost of increased complexity and a steeper learning curve when compared to higher-level languages like _Python_ or _JS_.

## Modern C++

The definition of _Modern C++_ generally refers to the language features introduced in the _C++11_ standard, and the ones that came after it. (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20)

- Those new standards introduced many new features, such as _smart pointers_, _lambdas_, _range-based for loops_, _constexpr_, _auto_, _move semantics_ and many more.
- These features make C++ much more expressive, and allow for more concise and readable code, while also improving performance and safety.

## Build Process

- The C++ build process converts `.cpp` files into executable programs as `.o` or `.obj` files, and then links them together into a single executable via the _linker_.
